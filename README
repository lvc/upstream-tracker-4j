NAME:
  Java Upstream Tracker - a project to monitor and verify compatibility of upstream API changes in Java libraries.
  
  Web: http://abi-laboratory.pro/java/tracker/
  
  The tool is developed by Andrey Ponomarenko: http://abi-laboratory.pro/

REQUIRES:
  Perl 5
  Java API Tracker (1.0 or newer)
  Java API Monitor (1.0 or newer)
  Java API Compliance Checker (1.7 or newer)
  PkgDiff (1.6.4 or newer)
  
  You can use the installer-4j to automatically download from github and install necessary tools: https://github.com/lvc/installer-4j

TEST PLAN:
  The file "scripts/testplan" contains the list of libraries to be monitored. You can write several libraries in one line separated by semicolon if you want to handle these libraries one-by-one in the specific order on one CPU. Other libraries will be processed in parallel on two CPUs.

DAILY RUN:
  This script is used to organize daily runs of the API Tracker and API Monitor tools:
  
  perl scripts/daily-run.pl

LOGS:
  See logs in the "daily_log/" directory.

PUBLISH REPORTS:
  You can copy reports to a hosting defined by HOST_ADDR and HOST_DIR variables in the "scripts/host.conf" file. The script will copy all necessary reports and styles (compressed as tar.gz) via scp to the hosting directory:
  
  perl scripts/copy-files.pl [library]

Enjoy!
